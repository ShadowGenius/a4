# ICS 32 Assignment 4 Direct Messaging App

## Features

### Direct Messaging
You can send messages directly to other people connected to the ICS 32 DSU system.

### Contacts
You can add multiple contacts and easily switch between them to send messages and view your message history.

### DSU Profiles
You can create a .dsu file to save your Profile in. This allows you to save your message history locally and easily 'log in' for future uses of the app.

## How to Use

### Set Up

1) Run the a4.py file to start the application. A GUI should automatically appear.

2) Go to 'Settings' and click on 'Configure Server' to enter in the server IP, your username, and your password.

3) (Optional, but recommended): Go to 'File' and click on 'New' and choose a directory. This will create a .dsu file that holds your DSU Profile, enabling you to store your message history locally.

### Messaging Someone
